Here is a human-readable file format specification for the given optimisation problem, structured into the requested sections:

# Input data

This section describes the essential information required to define an instance of this specific optimization problem.

*   **Problem Type**: Indicates the mathematical nature of the problem. For this problem, it's a "Mixed Integer Linear Program" (MILP).
*   **Variables**: A list of decision variables in the problem. For each variable:
    *   **Name**: A unique identifier (e.g., `x_regular`, `x_special`).
    *   **Description**: A clear explanation of what the variable represents in the real-world context.
    *   **Type**: Specifies if the variable must take "Integer" values or can take "Continuous" (fractional) values.
    *   **Bounds**: Defines the lower and upper limits for the variable's value.
        *   A numerical value for a specific bound.
        *   `inf` or `null` to denote no upper bound.
        *   `-inf` or `null` to denote no lower bound.
*   **Objective Function**: The mathematical expression that needs to be maximized or minimized.
    *   **Sense**: Whether the objective is to "Maximize" or "Minimize".
    *   **Description**: A brief explanation of what the objective represents (e.g., total profit, total cost).
    *   **Coefficients**: For each variable, the numerical coefficient by which it is multiplied in the objective function.
*   **Constraints**: A set of conditions that the solution must satisfy. For each constraint:
    *   **Description**: A clear explanation of the real-world limitation or requirement it represents.
    *   **Coefficients**: For each variable, the numerical coefficient by which it is multiplied within this constraint.
    *   **Sense**: The relational operator connecting the left-hand side (variable expressions) to the right-hand side (constant value) (e.g., `<=`, `>=`, `=`).
    *   **Right-Hand Side (RHS)**: The constant value on the right side of the inequality/equality.

# Solution

This section describes the information that constitutes a valid solution to the optimization problem.

*   **Status**: The outcome of the optimization process. Possible values include:
    *   `Optimal`: A best possible solution satisfying all constraints was found.
    *   `Infeasible`: No solution exists that satisfies all constraints.
    *   `Unbounded`: The objective function can be improved indefinitely without violating constraints.
    *   `Feasible`: A solution satisfying all constraints was found, but it might not be optimal (e.g., due to time limits).
    *   `Error`: An error occurred during the optimization process.
*   **Objective Value**: The computed numerical value of the objective function at the optimal (or feasible) solution.
*   **Variable Values**: The numerical value assigned to each decision variable in the optimal (or feasible) solution.

# Constraints

Based on the provided JSON specification, the problem has the following constraints:

1.  **Problem Type**: The problem is a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP).
2.  **Variable Type Constraints**:
    *   `x_regular` must be an integer.
    *   `x_special` must be an integer.
3.  **Variable Bound Constraints**:
    *   `x_regular >= 0` (The number of regular sandwiches cannot be negative).
    *   `x_special >= 0` (The number of special sandwiches cannot be negative).
4.  **Egg Usage Constraint**: The total number of eggs used for regular and special sandwiches must not exceed the available eggs (45).
    *   **Formulation**: `2 * x_regular + 3 * x_special <= 45`
5.  **Bacon Usage Constraint**: The total number of bacon slices used for regular and special sandwiches must not exceed the available bacon slices (70).
    *   **Formulation**: `3 * x_regular + 5 * x_special <= 70`
