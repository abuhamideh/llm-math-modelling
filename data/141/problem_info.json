    "parametrized_description": "An international goods exporter uses ships and planes to transport goods. Each ship can carry ShipCapacity containers and consumes ShipFuel liters of fuel per trip. Each plane can carry PlaneCapacity containers and consumes PlaneFuel liters of fuel per trip. The company needs to transport at least MinContainers containers. Additionally, no more than MaxPlaneTrips plane trips can be made, and at least MinShipTripFraction of the total trips must be by ship. The objective is to minimize the total fuel consumption.",
