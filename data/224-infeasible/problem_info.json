    "parametrized_description": "A hospital hires UltrasoundTechnician and GraduateResearcher to image patients. An UltrasoundTechnician works UltrasoundTechnicianShiftHours per shift while a GraduateResearcher works GraduateResearcherShiftHours per shift. UltrasoundTechnicians are paid UltrasoundTechnicianPayment per shift while GraduateResearchers are paid GraduateResearcherPayment per shift. Due to regulations, there must be ShiftRatio times as many UltrasoundTechnician shifts as GraduateResearcher shifts. Currently, the hospital needs RequiredUltrasoundServiceHours of ultrasound services to meet needs. If the hospital has a budget of TotalBudget, how many of each worker certified to use the ultrasound should be scheduled to reduce the total number of workers?",
