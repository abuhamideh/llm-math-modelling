A ChopSaw can cut ChopSawCuttingCapacity pounds of steel and generates ChopSawWaste units of waste per day. A SteelCutter can cut SteelCutterCuttingCapacity pounds of steel and generates SteelCutterWaste units of waste per day. The metal-working shop must cut TotalCuttingRequirement pounds of metal every day. The waste generated must not exceed WasteLimit units per day. How should the metal-working shop purchase their metal-working equipment to minimize the total number of metal-working equipment needed?",
