Each calcium pill requires TimeToEffectCalcium time to become effective, and each vitamin D pill requires TimeToEffectVitaminD time to become effective. Over a month, the student must ingest at least MinTotalPills pills in total, with a minimum of MinVitaminDPills being vitamin D pills. Additionally, the number of calcium pills taken must exceed the number of vitamin D pills. The objective is to minimize the total time for the medication to become effective.",
