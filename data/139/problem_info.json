Each van trip has a capacity of VanCapacity boxes and costs VanCost dollars, while each truck trip has a capacity of TruckCapacity boxes and costs TruckCost dollars. The company needs to transport at least MinBoxes boxes with a total cost not exceeding Budget dollars. Additionally, the number of van trips must be greater than the number of truck trips. The objective is to minimize the total number of trips.",
