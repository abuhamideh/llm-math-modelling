Each model plane requires WoodPerPlane units of wood and PaintPerPlane units of paint. The hobbyist has AvailableWood units of wood and AvailablePaint units of paint. The profit per model train is ProfitTrain and the profit per model plane is ProfitPlane. The hobbyist aims to determine the number of each to produce to maximize profit.",
