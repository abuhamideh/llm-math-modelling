    "parametrized_description": "A flooring company produces two types of products: hardwood and vinyl planks. The weekly production of hardwood must be at least MinimumDemandHardwood and no more than MaxProductionHardwood. Similarly, the weekly production of vinyl planks must be at least MinimumDemandVinyl and no more than MaxProductionVinyl. Additionally, the combined weekly production of both hardwood and vinyl planks must be at least MinimumTotalShipping. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as ProfitHardwood multiplied by the quantity of hardwood produced plus ProfitVinyl multiplied by the quantity of vinyl planks produced.",
