'''
Define decision variables for the number of seasonal volunteers and full-time
volunteers. The objective is to maximize the total number of gifts delivered,
calculated as GiftsPerSeasonal multiplied by the number of seasonal volunteers
plus GiftsPerFullTime multiplied by the number of full-time volunteers. The
constraints are that the total points awarded, PointsPerSeasonal times seasonal
volunteers plus PointsPerFullTime times full-time volunteers, does not exceed
PointsLimit; the number of seasonal volunteers does not exceed
MaxSeasonalPercentage of the total number of volunteers; and the number of full-
time volunteers is at least MinFullTimeVolunteers.
