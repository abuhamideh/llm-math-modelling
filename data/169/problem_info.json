Each cargo plane trip transports TiresPerPlaneTrip tires and costs CostPerPlaneTrip dollars. Each ultrawide truck trip transports TiresPerTruckTrip tires and costs CostPerTruckTrip dollars. The company needs to transport at least MinTires tires and has a budget of AvailableBudget dollars. The number of cargo plane trips cannot exceed the number of ultrawide truck trips. Determine the number of cargo plane trips and ultrawide truck trips to minimize the total number of trips.",
