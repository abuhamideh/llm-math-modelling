The cost to generate each personal license is CostPersonalLicense, and the cost to generate each commercial license is CostCommercialLicense. The marketing department estimates that the total number of licenses sold per month cannot exceed MaxTotalLicenses. The profit earned from each personal license is ProfitPersonalLicense, and the profit earned from each commercial license is ProfitCommercialLicense.
