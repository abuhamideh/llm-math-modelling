Each regular batch requires MedicinalIngredientPerRegularBatch units of medicinal ingredients and RehydrationProductPerRegularBatch units of rehydration product. Each premium batch requires MedicinalIngredientPerPremiumBatch units of medicinal ingredients and RehydrationProductPerPremiumBatch units of rehydration product. The company has TotalMedicinalIngredients units of medicinal ingredients and TotalRehydrationProduct units of rehydration product available. The number of regular batches produced must be at least MinRegularBatches and less than the number of premium batches. Each regular batch can treat PeopleTreatedPerRegularBatch people and each premium batch can treat PeopleTreatedPerPremiumBatch people. The objective is to determine the number of regular and premium batches to produce in order to maximize the total number of people treated.",
