    "parametrized_description": "A clinic processes patients using an automatic machine and a manual machine. Let A represent the number of patients processed by the automatic machine and M represent the number of patients processed by the manual machine. The total processing time, calculated as AutomaticMachineTimePerPatient multiplied by A plus ManualMachineTimePerPatient multiplied by M, must not exceed TotalAvailableTime. Additionally, the number of patients processed by the manual machine must be at least ManualPatientMinRatio times A, and the automatic machine must process at least AutomaticMachineMinimumPatients. The objective is to maximize the total number of patients, which is the sum of A and M.",
