    "parametrized_description": "A patient takes anxiety medication and anti-depressants sequentially. Each unit of anxiety medication takes TimePerAnxietyUnit time to be effective, while each unit of anti-depressant takes TimePerAntidepressantUnit time to be effective. The patient must take at least MinimumTotalUnits of medication, with at least MinimumAnxietyUnits being anxiety medication. Additionally, the amount of anxiety medication cannot exceed MaximumAnxietyToAntidepressantRatio times the amount of anti-depressants. The objective is to determine the number of units of each medication to minimize the total time until the medications become effective.",
