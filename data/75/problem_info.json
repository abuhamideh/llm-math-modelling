    "parametrized_description": "A man fishes in a lake of TotalLakeArea acres and can catch fish either using a net or fishing line. For each acre of the lake, using a net will catch FishPerAcreNet fish and requires BaitPerAcreNet units of bait but also causes PainPerAcreNet units of pain for the fisherman. For each acre of the lake, using a fishing line will catch FishPerAcreLine fish and requires BaitPerAcreLine units of bait but also causes PainPerAcreLine units of pain for the fisherman. The fisherman has available TotalAvailableBait units of bait and can tolerate at most MaxTotalPain units of pain. Determine the number of acres to allocate to each fishing method to maximize the number of fish caught.",
