    "parametrized_description": "A clothing company can sell their product in two types of stores: a retail store and a factory outlet. A retail store brings in CustomersPerRetailStore customers every day and requires EmployeesPerRetailStore employees to operate. A factory outlet brings in CustomersPerFactoryOutlet customers every day and requires EmployeesPerFactoryOutlet employees to run. Company executives decided that there must be at least MinTotalCustomers customers every day and can make available MaxTotalEmployees employees. The company aims to minimize the number of stores that must be open.",
