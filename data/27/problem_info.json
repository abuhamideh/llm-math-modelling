    "parametrized_description": "The food truck owner allocates funds up to MaxSpendingBudget for purchasing mangos and guavas, with each mango costing CostMango and each guava costing CostGuava. Each mango sold generates a profit of ProfitMango and each guava sold generates a profit of ProfitGuava. The monthly sales of mangos are constrained to be at least MinMangosSold and at most MaxMangosSold. Furthermore, the number of guavas sold is limited to a maximum ratio defined by MaxGuavaToMangoRatio relative to the number of mangos sold. The goal is to determine the optimal quantities of mangos and guavas to sell in order to maximize total profit.",
