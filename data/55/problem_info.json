Each well type produces ProductionPerAcre[i] units of oil per acre, generates PollutionPerAcre[i] units of pollution per acre, and requires DrillBitsPerAcre[i] drill bits per acre. The company has a total of TotalDrillBits drill bits available and must limit pollution to at most MaxPollution units. The objective is to determine the number of acres allocated to each well type to maximize total oil production.",
