Each train can transport TrainCapacity people per hour comfortably and each tram can transport TramCapacity people per hour comfortably. Since trains take longer to build, the number of trams must be at least MinTramsToTrainsRatio times the number of trains. If the railway company wants to transport at least MinPeoplePerHour people per hour, minimize the total number of transportation units required.",
