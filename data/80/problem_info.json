Each full time worker works FullTimeHoursPerShift hours per shift and is paid FullTimePayPerShift per shift, while each part time worker works PartTimeHoursPerShift hours per shift and is paid PartTimePayPerShift per shift. The firm has a project requiring LaborHoursRequired hours of labor and has a budget of TotalBudget. The firm should schedule a number of full time and part time workers to minimize the total number of workers.",
