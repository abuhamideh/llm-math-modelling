    "parametrized_description": "A bubble tea shop produces two types of bubble teas: mango and lychee. Each mango bubble tea requires MangoJuicePerMangoTea units of mango juice and TeaPerMangoTea units of tea. Each lychee bubble tea requires LycheeJuicePerLycheeTea units of lychee juice and TeaPerLycheeTea units of tea. The shop has a total of TotalMangoJuice units of mango juice and TotalLycheeJuice units of lychee juice available. At least MinLycheePercentage of the total bubble teas produced must be lychee flavored. Additionally, the number of mango bubble teas produced must be greater than the number of lychee bubble teas. The objective is to determine the number of mango and lychee bubble teas to produce in order to minimize the total amount of tea used.",
