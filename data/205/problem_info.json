Each WashingMachine requires InspectionTimeWashingMachine minutes for inspection and FixingTimeWashingMachine minutes for fixing, while each Freezer requires InspectionTimeFreezer minutes for inspection and FixingTimeFreezer minutes for fixing. The total available InspectionTime is TotalInspectionTime minutes and the total available schedule time is TotalScheduleTime minutes. Repairing each WashingMachine yields EarningsPerWashingMachine and each Freezer yields EarningsPerFreezer. Determine the number of WashingMachines and Freezers to repair to maximize total earnings.",
