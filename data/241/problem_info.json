    "parametrized_description": "A candle-making company can transport candles using freight and air. Freight can transport FreightCapacityPerTrip tons per trip, while air can transport AirCapacityPerTrip tons per trip. Each freight trip costs FreightCostPerTrip dollars, and each air trip costs AirCostPerTrip dollars. The company needs to transport at least MinimumTotalTons of candles and has a transportation budget of Budget dollars. Additionally, at least MinimumAirProportion proportion of the total tons must be transported via air. There must also be at least MinimumFreightTrips freight trips. The objective is to determine the number of freight and air trips to minimize the total number of trips.",
