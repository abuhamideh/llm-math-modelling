He must grow at least MinAcresPotatoes acres of potatoes and at least MinAcresCucumbers acres of cucumbers to meet his contract. Mark prefers to grow more cucumbers than potatoes, but he can grow at most MaxCucumbersPerPotatoesRatio times as many cucumbers as potatoes. The profit per acre of potatoes is ProfitPerAcrePotatoes and the profit per acre of cucumbers is ProfitPerAcreCucumbers. He aims to determine the number of acres to allocate to each crop to maximize his total profit.",
