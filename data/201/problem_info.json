    "parametrized_description": "A company produces two types of flooring products: laminate planks and carpets. Let the production levels of laminate planks and carpets be represented by variables. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which is calculated by multiplying the production level of laminate planks by LaminateProfitPerSqFt and the production level of carpets by CarpetProfitPerSqFt, then summing these two amounts. The production levels must satisfy the following constraints: the production of laminate planks must be at least MinLaminateDemand and no more than MaxLaminateProduction; the production of carpets must be at least MinCarpetDemand and no more than MaxCarpetProduction; and the combined production of both products must meet or exceed MinTotalShipping.",
